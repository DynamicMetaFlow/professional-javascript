# Intro to Backbone

We in the Backbone community have been working hard to get better instructional resources assembled for the library. Some good introcutions to the tool include:

* [Backbone - Getting Started](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-View-separation)
* [Backbone, The Primer](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Backbone%2C-The-Primer)
