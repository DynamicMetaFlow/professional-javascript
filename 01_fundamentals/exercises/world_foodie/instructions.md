# World Foodie

Let's get comfortable with the basics. For this exercise, use the browser `prompt` command to get input from the user:

```
var userName = prompt('What is your name?');
```

**Objectives:**

 - Use variables.
 - Use conditionals.

**Process:**

1. Ask for the user's name.

2. Ask for the user's favorite food.

3. Ask the user if they like to travel (`"yes"` or `"no"`)

4. Print the following outcomes into the console:

```
- Print out `"Hello, [user name]!"`
- If the user's favorite food is "Tandoori Chicken" and they travel, tell them they should go to India.
- If the user's favorite food is "Burritos" and they travel, tell them they should go to Mexico.
- If the user doesn't travel, tell them they should seek out bad American `[favorite food]`.
```

## Bonus

- Respond to all capitalizations of the provided food name (ex: "Burrito" or "burrito").
