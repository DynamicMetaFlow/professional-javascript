# Professional JavaScript

This workshop introduces professional-level JavaScript development. The curriculum covers foundation concepts of JavaScript programming and basic computer science. The goal of this workshop is to establish a technical knowledge base for our participants to continue building upon in their careers. While this is a beginner-level course, the curriculum is expansive and highly technical. Participants of all experience levels should come prepared for a challenge.

## Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with basic HTML and CSS. A pre-course primer on JavaScript will also help you succeed. You can pursue free lessons on these subjects at [dash.generalassemb.ly](http://dash.generalassemb.ly).

## Takeaways
- Foundation concepts of computer science.
- Intermediate-level concepts of the JavaScript programming language.
- Foundation knowledge of how JavaScript makes the web interactive.

## Day 1: Fundamentals

Our first session will cover the very basics of computer science, using JavaScript as our language of study. For participants with past programming experience, this cirriculum should be generally familiar.
