# Professional JavaScript

This workshop introduces professional-level JavaScript development. The curriculum covers foundation concepts of JavaScript programming and basic computer science. The goal of this workshop is to establish a technical knowledge base for our participants to continue building upon in their careers. While this is a beginner-level course, the curriculum is expansive and highly technical. Participants of all experience levels should come prepared to be challenged.

## Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with basic HTML and CSS. A pre-course primer on JavaScript will also help you succeed. You can pursue free lessons on these subjects at [dash.generalassemb.ly](http://dash.generalassemb.ly).

## Takeaways
- Foundation concepts of computer science.
- Intermediate-level concepts of the JavaScript programming language.
- Foundation knowledge of how JavaScript makes the web interactive.
