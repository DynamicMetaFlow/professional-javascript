# Professional JavaScript

This workshop introduces professional-level JavaScript development. The curriculum covers foundation concepts of JavaScript programming and basic computer science. The goal of this workshop is to establish a technical knowledge base for our participants to continue building upon in their careers. While this is a beginner-level course, the curriculum is expansive and highly technical. Participants of all past experience levels should come prepared to be challenged.

## Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with basic HTML and CSS. A pre-course primer on JavaScript will also help you succeed. You can pursue free lessons on these subjects at [dash.generalassemb.ly](http://dash.generalassemb.ly).

## Takeaways
- Foundation concepts of computer science.
- Foundation knowledge of how JavaScript makes the web interactive.
- Intermediate-level concepts of the JavaScript programming language.

## Day 1: Fundamentals

Our first session will cover the very basics of computer science, using JavaScript as our language of study. For participants with past programming experience, this cirriculum will be familiar territory. However, learning JavaScript syntax and conventions is valuable first step for anyone approaching the language.
